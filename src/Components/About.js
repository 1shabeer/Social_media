         <p style={{marginTop:'1em'}}>Creating a social media project using React.js and CSS 
            for styling involves setting up a structured web application that includes various 
            sections such as navigation, header, footer, posts, and editing features. The project 
            will use JSON fake data to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The 
            app will include functionalities for adding new posts, editing existing ones, and deleting 
            posts. Custom hooks 
            will be used to manage the state and operations, providing a clean and modular approach.<br/><br/>

The application structure will include the following sections: <br/><br/>
  Navigation: This will serve as the main menu, allowing users to navigate through different sections of the app.<br/>
 Header: This will contain the title of the application and any other relevant information.<br/>
 Footer: This section will provide additional information or links, typically found at the bottom of the page.<br/>
 Post: This will display the list of posts, each containing a title, date, time, and content. Each post will have edit and delete buttons.<br/>
 EditPostod: This section will allow users to edit the details of an existing post.<br/>
 NewPost: This section will enable users to add new posts.<br/>
 Missing: This will handle any missing routes or pages not found within the application.<br/><br/>

By using React.js for the frontend and CSS for styling, the project will offer a dynamic and responsive user 
interface. The use of JSON fake data will simplify the development process by providing a simulated backend 
for testing CRUD operations. Custom hooks in React will manage the application state and encapsulate the logic
 for interacting with the fake data.<br/><br/>

The primary features of this application will include:<br/><br/>
1. Displaying Posts: Showing a list of posts with titles, dates, times, and content.<br/>
2. Adding Posts: Providing a form for users to create new posts.<br/>
3. Editing Posts: Allowing users to edit the content of existing posts.<br/>
4. Deleting Posts: Enabling users to remove posts from the list.<br/><br/>

This project aims to provide a comprehensive example of a social media application, demonstrating the use of React.js, CSS, JSON fake data, and custom hooks for a full-featured web application.</p>
